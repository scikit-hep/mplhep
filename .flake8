# E124: closing bracket does not match visual indentation
# E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# F401: some imports are used by code which is dynamically loaded <- check again later
# F403: ‘from module import *’ used; unable to detect undefined names
# F405: name may be undefined, or defined from star imports: module
# Ignoring the next one for valid tests
# F811: redefinition of unused name from line N
# This one is bad. Sometimes ordering matters, conditional imports
# setting env vars necessary etc.
# E402: module level import not at top of file
# E129: Visual indent to not match indent as next line, counter eg here:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/386
# W504: Raised by flake8 even when it is followed
